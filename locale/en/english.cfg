[mod-setting-description]
power-pole-powered-area-lighted-percent=The percentage of each power pole's powered area that is lit. The greater of a power pole's "lighted powered area" and its "lighted connection reach" will set the light size. Mod Default Setting = 100
power-pole-connection-reach-lighted-percent=The percentage of each power pole's connection reach (between poles) that is lit. The greater of a power pole's "lighted powered area" and "lighted connection reach" will set the light size. Mod Default Setting = 0
light-power-usage-watts=The power usage of each inbuilt light. When set to 0 watts no electrical network is required for them to work. Anything above 0 watts requires active electricity for them to work. A standard light is 5000 watts. Mod Default Setting = 0.
turrets-lighted-edge-tiles=If all turrets are lighted and the number of tiles beyond the edge lit. Setting to 0 is just the turret size. Setting to -1 disables the feature. Use in early game only as once above 500 turrets it can slow down UPS/game speed. Mod Default Setting = -1
research-unlock=Adds a cheap early game research that must be completed to get the lighting feature.
inbuilt_lighting-light_brightness=The range is from 0 (no light) to 1 (full light). 0.6 is the default value.
